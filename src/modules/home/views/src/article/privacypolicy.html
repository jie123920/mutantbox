Cookies and Other Information on a User&#39;s Machine</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-family: &#39;Open Sans&#39;, sans-serif;">Mutantbox’s products, services and sites may employ cookies and other technologies such as web beacons and pixel tags.

Use of cookies is typically associated with websites. For example, when you sign in to Mutantbox online websites , we stores your user id and a combination of your IP address and time of login as a cookie on your hard drive. This cookie allows you to move from page to page without having to sign in again on each page.

This automatically generated bug report information may include information about other software or hardware on a user&#39;s system. Mutantbox does not associate and store the automatically generated bug report information with users’ personally identifiable information. Any bug reporting information manually submitted by users (e.g. through Mutantbox&#39;s Bug Reporter form) is associated and stored with personally identifiable information sent voluntarily by the user through a bug report.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: &#39;Open Sans&#39;, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: &#39;Open Sans&#39;, sans-serif;">8.
